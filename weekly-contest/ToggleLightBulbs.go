// Question :

// You are given an array bulbs of integers between 1 and 100.
// There are 100 light bulbs numbered from 1 to 100. All of them are switched off initially.
// For each element bulbs[i] in the array bulbs:
// If the bulbs[i]th light bulb is currently off, switch it on.
// Otherwise, switch it off.
// Return the list of integers denoting the light bulbs that are on in the end, sorted in ascending order. If no bulb is on, return an empty list.
// Example 1:
// Input: bulbs = [10,30,20,10]
// Output: [20,30]
// Explanation:
// The bulbs[0] = 10th light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
// The bulbs[1] = 30th light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
// The bulbs[2] = 20th light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
// The bulbs[3] = 10th light bulb is currently on. We switch it off.
// In the end, the 20th and the 30th light bulbs are on.
// Example 2:
// Input: bulbs = [100,100]
// Output: []
// Explanation:
// The bulbs[0] = 100th light bulb is currently off. We switch it on.
// The bulbs[1] = 100th light bulb is currently on. We switch it off.
// In the end, no light bulb is on.
// Constraints:
// 1 <= bulbs.length <= 100
// 1 <= bulbs[i] <= 100

// Answer :

func ToggleLightBulbs(bulbs []int) (r []int) {
	m := map[int]int{}
	for _, v := range bulbs {
		m[v]++
	}
	for _, b := range bulbs {
		if m[b]%2 != 0 {
			r = append(r, b)
			m[b] = 0
		}
	}
	sort.Ints(r)
	return
}
