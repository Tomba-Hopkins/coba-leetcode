// Question :

// Given a string s, you have two types of operation:
// Choose an index i in the string, and let c be the character in position i. Delete the closest occurrence of c to the left of i (if exists).
// Choose an index i in the string, and let c be the character in position i. Delete the closest occurrence of c to the right of i (if exists).
// Your task is to minimize the length of s by performing the above operations zero or more times.
// Return an integer denoting the length of the minimized string.
// Example 1:
// Input: s = "aaabc"
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// Operation 2: we choose i = 1 so c is 'a', then we remove s[2] as it is closest 'a' character to the right of s[1].
// s becomes "aabc" after this.
// Operation 1: we choose i = 1 so c is 'a', then we remove s[0] as it is closest 'a' character to the left of s[1].
// s becomes "abc" after this.
// Example 2:
// Input: s = "cbbd"
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// Operation 1: we choose i = 2 so c is 'b', then we remove s[1] as it is closest 'b' character to the left of s[1].
// s becomes "cbd" after this.
// Example 3:
// Input: s = "baadccab"
// Output: 4
// Explanation:
// Operation 1: we choose i = 6 so c is 'a', then we remove s[2] as it is closest 'a' character to the left of s[6].
// s becomes "badccab" after this.
// Operation 2: we choose i = 0 so c is 'b', then we remove s[6] as it is closest 'b' character to the right of s[0].
// s becomes "badcca" fter this.
// Operation 2: we choose i = 3 so c is 'c', then we remove s[4] as it is closest 'c' character to the right of s[3].
// s becomes "badca" after this.
// Operation 1: we choose i = 4 so c is 'a', then we remove s[1] as it is closest 'a' character to the left of s[4].
// s becomes "bdca" after this.
// Constraints:
// 1 <= s.length <= 100
// s contains only lowercase English letters

// Answer :
func MinimizedStringLength(s string) int {
	m := map[rune]int{}
	for _, r := range s {
		m[r]++
	}
	return len(m)
}
