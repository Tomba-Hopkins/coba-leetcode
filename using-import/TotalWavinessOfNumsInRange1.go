// Question :

// You are given two integers num1 and num2 representing an inclusive range [num1, num2].
// The waviness of a number is defined as the total count of its peaks and valleys:
// A digit is a peak if it is strictly greater than both of its immediate neighbors.
// A digit is a valley if it is strictly less than both of its immediate neighbors.
// The first and last digits of a number cannot be peaks or valleys.
// Any number with fewer than 3 digits has a waviness of 0.
// Return the total sum of waviness for all numbers in the range [num1, num2].
// Example 1:
// Input: num1 = 120, num2 = 130
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// In the range [120, 130]:
// 120: middle digit 2 is a peak, waviness = 1.
// 121: middle digit 2 is a peak, waviness = 1.
// 130: middle digit 3 is a peak, waviness = 1.
// All other numbers in the range have a waviness of 0.
// Thus, total waviness is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
// Example 2:
// Input: num1 = 198, num2 = 202
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// In the range [198, 202]:
// 198: middle digit 9 is a peak, waviness = 1.
// 201: middle digit 0 is a valley, waviness = 1.
// 202: middle digit 0 is a valley, waviness = 1.
// All other numbers in the range have a waviness of 0.
// Thus, total waviness is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
// Example 3:
// Input: num1 = 4848, num2 = 4848
// Output: 2
// Explanation:
// Number 4848: the second digit 8 is a peak, and the third digit 4 is a valley, giving a waviness of 2.
// Constraints:
// 1 <= num1 <= num2 <= 105

// Answer :
func TotalWavinessOfNumsInRange1(num1 int, num2 int) (r int) {
	for i := num1; i <= num2; i++ {
		s := strconv.Itoa(i)
		for j := 0; j < len(s); j++{
			if j != 0 && j != len(s) - 1 {
				if s[j] > s[j - 1] && s[j] > s[j + 1] || s[j] < s[j - 1] && s[j] < s[j + 1]{
					r++
				}
			}
		}
	}
	return
